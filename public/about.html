<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After graduating from high school, I began my studies in the field of Technological Machines and Equipment with a specialization in Road Construction Machinery and Equipment at the Azerbaijan University of Architecture and Construction. I successfully completed this program with honors in 2012. From 2013 to 2014, I worked as a Technical Assistant intern in the construction industry at FBCO GmbH. My responsibilities there included planning and coordinating workflow and treating the surfaces of workpieces. Additionally, I worked as an intern Metal Construction Technician at Del√ºks GmbH from 2015 to 2016, where I was responsible for creating design, execution, and detail plans.</p>
<p>In 2021, I began my studies in the field of Computer Science at the University of Rostock. The rapid advancement of technology and the fact that computer science plays a crucial role in nearly all aspects of society today have motivated me to acquire knowledge in this field as well. I now aim to further develop and deepen my expertise by entering the business world and applying my theoretical knowledge in practical settings.</p>
